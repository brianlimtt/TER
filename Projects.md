    Jekyll GitHub Project
  </summary>

  <br>

  <strong>Jekyll Github Project</strong><br>
  This first assignment required me to use jekyll themes to import into github pages. 
  I learned how to create a new repo and new files, and create new pages for my website.

    Anscombe's Quartet Analysis
  </summary>

  <br>

  <strong>Anscombe's Quartet Analysis</strong><br>
  This project required me to explore Anscombe’s Quartet to understand the importance of visualizing data alongside summary statistics.  
  I learned how datasets with identical statistical properties can have very different distributions and trends.

  <strong>About the Project</strong><br>
  This project was built using <strong>Python</strong> (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) and visualized with interactive plots.  
  The goal was to demonstrate why relying solely on mean, variance, and correlation can be misleading without graphical analysis.

    EDA Blog Summary
  </summary>

  <br>

  <strong>EDA Blog Summary</strong><br>
  This assingment required me to read and review the blog on <a href="https://datascienceguide.github.io/exploratory-data-analysis" target="_blank">Exploratory Data Analysis</a>. 

  <hr>

  <strong>About the Project</strong><br>
  This project required me to do something different. I wanted to use a different style for the blog site as the minima style that I have been using did not seem appropriate for a blog. I ended up creating a new repo with the    'tactile' theme as I believed it was better suited for a blog post. I formattd the home page, with a short introduction and table of contents that would lead into my blogs that I have posted. In the blog, I highlighted some key points that I found inside of the <a href="https://datascienceguide.github.io/exploratory-data-analysis" target="_blank">EDA</a> guide. I also made it so the table of contents was clickable, leading users to instantly jump to that section, saving time.
