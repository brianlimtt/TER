## Surprise!
My blog is located on another repository so I am able to have a better and nicer looking style to present it! You can locate the github page through this <a href="https://brianlimtt.github.io/TER-blog/" target="_blank">link</a><br>
You can also locate the repo on github through this <a href="https://github.com/brianlimtt/TER-blog/tree/main" target="_blank">link</a><br>
